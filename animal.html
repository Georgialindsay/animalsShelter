             <h2>History</h2>
             <p> Southampton Animal Resue Centre (SARC) was founded in 2005, by Robert G. Levinson. His goal was to rescue as many unwanted animals as possible around the Southampton area,
             and give them a safe place to live until their forever home was found. Today, over 500 animals are handed in to SARC every year, from tiny puppies to giant horses. If you are
             looking for a furry friend to complete your family, then look no further than the Southampton Animal Rescue Centre, to give a loving pet a second chance at a happy life.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h2>Our Mission</h2>
             <p> Our mission at the SARC is to ensure that as many unwanted animals are taken care of as possible, and that we are able to re-home them as fast as we can. We beleive that every
               animal deserves to fulfill a happy life, not only by being adopted, but through the care we give them at the SARC before they find their forever home. This care includes: seeing to
               any medical needs, providing warm blankets and plenty of meals, and daily walks and play time. By interacting with our team, it also helps the animals to gain better people skills,
               to ensure they're ready for their new life once adopted!

             <p> Every year hundreds of animals are handed into the Southampton Animal Rescue Centre, with some even needing medical help. With more animals entering everyday, we
               struggle to afford the equipment and food needed to provide a healthy life for the animals, whilst they're staying with us. Your generous donations will help to buy
              vital pieces for the animals, from warm blankets in the winter, to plenty of food to keep them strong. If you wish to donate, please click the
              link below. </p>

              <h2> All donations, big and small are very welcome at the
            SARC. Thank you for your generosity!  </h2>
